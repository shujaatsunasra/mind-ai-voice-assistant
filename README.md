## 🎯 What is MIND?

MIND is a next-generation voice-first AI productivity assistant built with Flutter. Unlike traditional task managers, MIND uses advanced natural language processing and human-like speech synthesis to create an intimate, conversational productivity experience.

### Why MIND is Different

- **🗣️ Human-Like Voice Engine**: Research-calibrated speech synthesis with F0 declination, jitter/shimmer, and breath-group prosody
- **🧠 Context-Aware AI**: Understands your patterns, adapts to your energy levels, and knows when to push or support
- **🎭 Emotional Intelligence**: 13 emotion tags (quietly, firmly, warmly, drily, etc.) for nuanced communication
- **👂 Earphone-First Design**: Intimate nudges delivered privately through earphones, never intrusive speaker announcements
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: AES-256 encryption, local-first storage, your data never leaves your device
- **📊 Digital Wellbeing**: Tracks screen time, app usage, and focus patterns to provide intelligent insights

---

## ✨ Features

### Voice Pattern System
- **40+ Voice Patterns**: From morning orientation to late-night wrap, each with unique prosody
- **Adaptive Tone**: Adjusts proximity, urgency, warmth, challenge, and brevity based on context
- **Silence Intelligence**: Knows when to speak, when to pause, and when to stay silent

### Advanced Speech Engine
- **ElevenLabs-Grade TTS**: Implements 2026 technique parity with commercial voice AI
- **SSML Prosody**: iOS AVSpeechUtterance with per-utterance timing control
- **Syntagm Splitting**: Text-structure-driven prosody for natural phrasing
- **Speech Normalization**: Handles numbers, symbols, abbreviations, and markdown

### Memory Architecture
- **Episodic Memory**: Remembers conversations, promises, and patterns
- **Semantic Memory**: Builds knowledge about your tasks and priorities
- **Procedural Memory**: Learns your workflows and preferences
- **Encrypted Storage**: SQLite with AES-256-CBC encryption

### Intelligent Nudging
- **Background Service**: Runs as foreground service for persistent awareness
- **Earphone Detection**: Real-time wired/Bluetooth earphone state monitoring
- **Context-Aware Timing**: Nudges based on task idle time, deferrals, and promises
- **Escalation Patterns**: From gentle reminders to direct challenges

### Digital Wellbeing Integration
- **Screen Time Tracking**: Android UsageStatsManager integration
- **Focus Block Detection**: Identifies and encourages deep work sessions
- **Fragmentation Analysis**: Detects scattered attention patterns
- **Social Media Awareness**: Gentle observations about time allocation

## 🎬 Demo

> **Note**: Add screenshots or video demo here

```dart
// Example: MIND adapting to user state
Pattern: THIRD_DEFERRAL
Tone: challenge=0.7, brevity=0.6, silenceIntent=0.7
Output: "We keep circling this task. What is actually in the way?"
[3500ms silence — waits for real answer]
```

## 🎨 Voice Pattern Examples

### Morning Orientation
```
Dimensions: proximity=0.4, warmth=0.7, pace=0.45
Output: "Morning. What is the one thing today?"
```

### Third Deferral (Challenge)
```
Dimensions: challenge=0.7, certainty=0.8, silenceIntent=0.7
Output: "Three deferrals. What is the real blocker?"
[3500ms pause]
```

### Task Complete
```
Dimensions: warmth=0.6, brevity=0.9, silenceIntent=0.85
Output: "Brilliant. Done."
[2800ms pause]
```

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- **Local-First**: All data stored on device
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Military-grade encryption for all stored data
- **Secure Enclave**: iOS Keychain / Android Keystore for key management
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no telemetry, no third-party SDKs
- **API Privacy**: Only sends conversation context to OpenAI, never raw usage data

---

## �️ Development

### Running Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Building for Production
```bash
# iOS
flutter build ios --release

# Android
flutter build apk --release
```

### Code Structure
- **Single-file architecture**: Entire app in `lib/main.dart` for maximum cohesion
- **Research-driven**: Voice engine based on acoustic phonetics research
- **Pattern-based**: Declarative voice patterns, not imperative logic
